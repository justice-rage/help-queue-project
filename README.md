# Help Queue Project

This project was cloned from an Epicodus educational repository to learn how to implement Redux with React.

## Important Note to Epicodus Students

This project contains all the code from the LearnHowToProgram.com Section 2: React Fundamentals coursework in which we created a Help Queue project. 

It is meant to be used as a starter repo to continue the Help Queue project in Section 3: React with Redux, starting in the lesson "Setting up Our First Redux Project":
